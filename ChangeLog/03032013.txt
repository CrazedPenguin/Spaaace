I managed to get gravity working.  It can be applied to any static mesh by 
converting the mesh to an InterpActor and giving it a trigger.  At the moment, 
it's working off a touch-based volume trigger.  The next step is to get the trigger
working with a gunshot.  It probably has something to do with a takeDamage trigger.

I also figured out that kismet sequences can be copied and pasted to and from text files.
This seems to be the best way to 'export' them, and I'll be doing that unless I find a better
way.
